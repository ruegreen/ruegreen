# Hey, I'm Rue Green 👋

**Principal Cloud Architect | AI/ML Engineer | 4x CCIE | DevNet Expert**

I architect and build enterprise-scale AI, cloud, and infrastructure systems. With 20+ years of hands-on engineering experience, I focus on the intersection of AI/ML and enterprise infrastructure — building LLM agent stacks, developing agentic AI orchestration frameworks, and designing production cloud platforms.

---

### 🔧 What I'm Building

- **MCP Server Frameworks** — Model Context Protocol servers for enterprise AI Agent integration (CRM, ITSM, EHR, and custom platforms)
- **LLM Agent Orchestration** — Multi-agent systems with local LLM deployment using Ollama on GPU infrastructure
- **Full Stack SaaS** — Production MERN stack applications with containerized microservices and CI/CD pipelines
- **Network Automation** — Infrastructure-as-code, YANG models, and programmatic network management

### 🧠 Currently

- **MS Computer Science (Machine Learning)** — Georgia Institute of Technology (Dec 2026)
- Leading AI/ML integration initiatives for enterprise contact center platforms
- Benchmarking BYOLLM architectures on GPU-accelerated hardware
